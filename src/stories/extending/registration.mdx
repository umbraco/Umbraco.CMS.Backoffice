# Registration

TODO: describe the registration process and the extension registry.
TODO: add typescript interface

```ts
import { extensionRegistry } from '@umbraco-cms/extension-registry';
```

## Package Manifest

TODO: Describe the Package Manifest

```json
// show example of package-manifest.json
```

## UI Extension Registration

Registering UI extensions happens through the global extension registry.

There are two ways to register UI extensions:

1. Reference an entry point resource in the manifest where full control over registration can take place.
2. Directly through a manifest file

### Entry Point Manifest

TODO: describe where to position the entry point manifest file. Describe the UI extension manifest.

**_Register an entry point in a JSON manifest_**

```json
{
	"type": "entryPoint",
	"alias": "My.EntryPoint",
	"js": "./index.js"
}
```

**_Register additional UI extensions in the entry point file_**

```ts
import { extensionRegistry } from "@umbraco-cms/extension-registry"

const manifest = {
  {
    type: '', // type of extension
    alias: '', // unique alias for the extension
    elementName: '', // unique name of the custom element
    js: '', // path to the javascript resource
    meta: {
      // additional props for the extension type
    }
  }
};

extensionRegistry.register(extension);
```

## Using Kinds for registration

Generally UI extensions, requires you to bring everything for the extension.
But there are several situations where you dont want to bring the full solution, just some configuration.

In this case we can use Extension 'Kinds'. Kinds enables you to extend a base configuration and make it your own.

To understand the concept of Kinds, lets look at the Header App extension type:

```ts
import { extensionRegistry } from '@umbraco-cms/extension-registry';

const manifest = {
	type: 'headerApp',
	kind: 'button',
	name: 'My Header App Example',
	alias: 'My.HeaderApp.Example',
	meta: {
		label: 'My Example',
		icon: 'umb:home',
		href: '/some/path/to/open/when/clicked',
	},
};

extensionRegistry.register(extension);
```

The above example does not provide a element, but is still visually present through a button element.
The this element comes from the kind 'button'.

Backoffice comes with a set of predefined Kinds, and you can even create your own.

Many of the build-in Kinds comes with a default element, but it could be anything. To understand the abilities we can look closer at the registration of your own Kinds.

## Registering a kind

The registration of Kinds, is done in the same maner as the registration of other extensions.
But the format of it is quite different, lets look at the Kind registration of the Header App Button Kind (The kind used in the above example):

```ts
import { extensionRegistry } from '@umbraco-cms/extension-registry';

const manifest: ManifestKind = {
	type: 'kind',
	alias: 'Umb.Kind.Button',
	matchType: 'headerApp',
	matchKind: 'button',
	manifest: {
		elementName: 'umb-header-app-button',
	},
};

umbExtensionsRegistry.register(manifest);
```

The root properties of this object, defines the Kind registration.
And then the manifest property holds the base extension manifest that users of this Kind will be extending.
This object can hold the property values that makes sense for the Kind.

In the above example the only property value defined a elementName, which is enough to create the button element for all extensions using this Kind.

### JSON Manifest files

TODO: describe how and where to position the JSON manifest files

```json
{
	"type": "", // type of extension
	"alias": "", // unique alias for the extension
	"elementName": "", // unique name of the custom element
	"js": "", // path to the javascript resource
	"meta": {
		// additional props for the extension type
	}
}
```
