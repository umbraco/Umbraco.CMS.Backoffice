# Repositories

TODO: make this understandable for others

A repository is the Backoffices entry point to request data and get notified about updates. Each domain should register their own repository in the Backoffice.

## Register a repository:

```js
import { umbExtensionRegistry } from '@umbraco-cms/extensions-registry';
import { MyRepository } from './MyRepository';

const repositoryManifest = {
	type: 'repository',
	alias: 'My.Repository',
	name: 'My Repository',
	class: MyRepository,
};
```

With a repository we can have different data sources depending on the state of the app. It can be from a server, an offline database, a store, a Signal-R connection, etc. That means that the consumer will not have to be concerned how to access the data, add or remove items from a collection of items, etc. This means we get a loose connection between the consumer and the data storing procedures hiding all complex implementation.

## Data flow with a repository

A repository has to be instanced in the context where it is used. It should take a host element as part of the constructor, so any contexts consumed in the repository (notifications, modals, etc.) get rendered in the correct DOM context.

A repository can be called directly from an element, but will often be instantiated in a context, like the Workspace Context.
