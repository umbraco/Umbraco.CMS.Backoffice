# Help us with Localization!

Localization of the New Backoffice is in full swing!
This is a work in process and here you can find the overview of all the sections that needs to be localized. We are also looking forward to see any contributions towards localization of the new Backoffice.


You may tick a section/subsection in the same PR as your changes, if it completes said section.


Before you start:
- Make sure you have read the [README](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.CMS.Backoffice/blob/main/.github/README.md) and [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.CMS.Backoffice/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Please note some sections may already be partly or fully localized without it being reflected in the overview just yet.
- Get an understanding of how we do localization in the new Backoffice. The explanations can be found in the stories under **Localization** by running `npm run storybook`. Alternatively see the raw story file [localization.mdx](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.CMS.Backoffice/blob/main/src/packages/core/localization/stories/localization.mdx)
